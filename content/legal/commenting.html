            Controversial, critical and negative comments are welcome and will be approved to enable a diverse 
            and lively exchange. Hence, the comments represent the expressions of the commentators and do not necessarily
            share the opinion of the website owner. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The website owner will not publish and delete illegal content and additionally reserves the right not to publish comments which he considers inappropriate.
        </li>
        <li>Providing an EMail address is optional. The address will be stored as a hash value in the database and
            only serves to clearly identify the author of a comment in case of a deletion request. If you do not provide your EMail address, you waive your 
            right to request deletion as it is not possible to clearly identify the originator.
