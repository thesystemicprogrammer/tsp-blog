            Hi, I am Thomas Berchtold. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            I have been working in the software industry for over 20 years in various roles such as 
            programmer, designer, architect or requirements engineer. Currently I am working as a 
            software engineer/coach/architect in transformation projects with a focus on the 
            definition and implementation of cloud native architectures as well as the enabling of 
            teams on new methods and technologies. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            While I still love to code, I am particularly passionate about the social aspects of 
            software engineering. How does the digital transformation change our job profiles, 
            how can we quickly acquire necessary new skills or which forms of collaboration allow 
            us to write better software? I consider the exploration of such types of questions to 
            be paramount if we are to evolve and improve as software engineers. 
        </p>
