            Hi, I am Thomas Berchtold. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            I have been working in the software industry for over 20 years in various roles such as 
            programmer, designer, architect or requirements engineer. Currently I am working as a 
            software engineer/coach/architect in transformation projects with a focus on defining 
            and implementing cloud native architectures as well as on enabling teams on new methods 
            and technologies. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            While I still love to code, I am particularly interested in the more complex 
            aspects of software engineering like: What can we do to write better software, 
            how do we learn new skills or what forms of collaboration help us to become
            more productive? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing blog posts about theses and similar questions is my way of learning about 
            these topics. If I have to explain and write down something in a concise 
            (and hopefully) understandable way, then I need to understand the underlying concepts 
            and acquire the required insights into the core ideas first. 
            
            Thus, this blog is primarily my private journal for organizing my thoughts and ideas. 
            But maybe there are articles which will also be useful for someone else. Therefore I 
            gladly share my thoughts in this blog and I would be very happy if we can get connected
            to start a vibrant exchange about software engineering and systems thinking.  
        </p>
