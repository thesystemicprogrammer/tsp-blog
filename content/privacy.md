## Our Commitment to Privacy

This is a private blog operated by an individual. We are committed to protecting your privacy and do not collect personal identifiable information. This privacy policy explains what limited data is collected and why.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

This website does **not** collect:
- No cookies for tracking purposes
- No personal information (name, email, etc.) unless you contact us directly
- No cross-site tracking
- No third-party analytics services
- No advertising trackers
- No social media pixels

## Server Log Files (Technical Necessity)

When you visit this website, the hosting provider (cyon AG, Switzerland) automatically creates server log files as a technical necessity. This is beyond our control and is required for the internet and hosting infrastructure to function.

### What is Logged
According to [cyon's documentation on raw logs](https://www.cyon.ch/support/a/raw-logs), the following technical data is recorded:
- IP address of the accessing device
- Date and time of access
- Requested URL
- HTTP status code
- Referrer (referring page, if available)
- Amount of data transferred
- Browser identification (name and version)

### Retention Period
Raw server logs are **automatically deleted after 24 hours**. We have disabled the website statistics feature provided by our hosting company, meaning no aggregated or processed statistics are created or stored beyond the 24-hour raw log period.

### Legal Basis and Jurisdiction
These logs are created and stored in accordance with cyon AG's [Terms of Service (AGB)](https://www.cyon.ch/legal/agb#chapter-10) and [Data Processing Agreement (Datenschutzvereinbarung)](https://www.cyon.ch/legal/datenschutz/#chapter-3). More information about log data storage can be found in cyon's article on [storage and retention of log data](https://www.cyon.ch/support/a/speicherung-und-aufbewahrung-von-log-daten).

The hosting infrastructure is located in Switzerland and subject to Swiss data protection laws.

## Page View Counter

We operate a privacy-first page view counter to understand which content is most popular. This counter is designed to collect **no personally identifiable information**.

### What We Collect
- **Aggregate view counts**: Total number of views per page (stored indefinitely as statistics)
- **Temporary deduplication hash**: An anonymized, one-way hash stored for 15 minutes only to prevent duplicate counting

### What We DO NOT Collect
- No IP addresses
- No personal information
- No cookies or persistent tracking identifiers
- No cross-site browsing behavior
- No user profiles or tracking across sessions

### How It Works
When you view a page, we create a temporary, one-way cryptographic hash using:
- Your browser's User-Agent (browser type and version)
- Language preferences (Accept-Language header)
- Encoding preferences (Accept-Encoding header)
- Referrer (where you came from)
- Operating system type
- Current 15-minute time window

This hash is completely anonymous and **cannot be reversed** to identify you. It is only used to prevent the same visit from being counted multiple times within a short period. The hash is automatically deleted after 15 minutes.

### Technical Implementation
For details on how the counter is implemented, see the [Counter API Documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/thesystemicprogrammer/tsp-blog/blob/main/static/api/counter/README.md).

### Data Retention
- **View counts**: Stored indefinitely as aggregate, anonymous statistics
- **Deduplication hashes**: Automatically deleted after 15 minutes
- **View timestamps**: Stored for analytics purposes (no user identification possible)

### Legal Basis (GDPR)
This processing is based on our legitimate interest in understanding content performance under **GDPR Article 6(1)(f)** (Legitimate Interests). Since we only collect anonymized, non-personal data that:
- Cannot identify individuals
- Expires automatically within 15 minutes
- Is processed using one-way cryptographic hashing

No consent is required under GDPR regulations. The data collected does not constitute "personal data" as defined in GDPR Article 4(1), as it cannot be used to identify a natural person.

## Your Rights Under GDPR

Since this website does not collect or process personal data (as defined under GDPR), the standard data subject rights (right to access, rectification, erasure, etc.) under Articles 15-22 GDPR do not apply.

However, regarding the server logs (which are under the control of our hosting provider):
- **Right to Information**: You have been informed about the log collection via this privacy policy
- **Right to Object**: Due to technical necessity, logs cannot be disabled, but they are automatically deleted after 24 hours
- **Responsible Party for Logs**: cyon AG, Brunngässlein 12, CH-4052 Basel, Switzerland

This website does not use cookies for tracking purposes. Your browser may store technical session cookies for functionality, but no tracking or analytics cookies are set by us.
