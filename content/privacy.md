## Information We Collect

This website is a personal blog. We do not collect personal information unless you choose to contact us directly.

## Cookies

This site does not use cookies for tracking purposes. You can disable cookies in your browser settings if needed.

## Page View Counter

We track page view statistics to understand which content is most popular and to improve our blog. Our view counter is designed with privacy-first principles:

### What We Collect
- **Aggregate view counts**: Total number of views per page
- **Temporary session data**: An anonymized fingerprint stored for 15 minutes only to prevent duplicate counting

### What We DO NOT Collect
- ❌ IP addresses
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Cookies or tracking identifiers
- ❌ Cross-site browsing behavior
- ❌ Any data that can identify you personally

### How It Works
When you view a page, we create a temporary, one-way hash using:
- Your browser's User-Agent (browser type and version)
- Language preferences
- Referrer (where you came from)
- Operating system type
- Current 15-minute time window

This hash is completely anonymous and automatically expires after 15 minutes. It cannot be reversed to identify you and is only used to prevent the same visit from being counted multiple times within a short time period.

### Legal Basis
This processing is based on our legitimate interest in understanding content performance (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)). Since we only collect anonymized, non-personal data that expires quickly, no consent is required under GDPR regulations.

### Data Retention
- **View counts**: Stored indefinitely as aggregate statistics
- **Deduplication hashes**: Automatically deleted after 15 minutes
- **View timestamps**: Stored for analytics purposes (no user identification)

### Your Rights
Since we don't collect personal data, standard GDPR rights (access, deletion, etc.) don't apply to the view counter. However, if you have questions about our data practices, please contact us.

## Third-Party Services

This site may use third-party services for analytics or hosting. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for more information.
