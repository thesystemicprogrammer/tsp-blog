## Welcome to The Systemic Programmer

Hello! I'm **Thomas Berchtold**, and this is my corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on programming and technology.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog focuses on:

- **Software Development** - Best practices, patterns, and real-world solutions
- **System Thinking** - Understanding how components work together
- **Technology Insights** - Deep dives into tools, frameworks, and methodologies
- **Personal Projects** - Sharing what I'm building and learning

## My Approach

I believe in thinking systemically about software - understanding not just individual components, but how they interact and influence each other. Whether it's architecture, code quality, or team dynamics, everything is connected.
