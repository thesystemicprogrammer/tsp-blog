      <description>&lt;p&gt;It might seem a dichotomy to mix the analytical tasks of programming with the holistic view of systems thinking together in

      <description>Hi, I am Thomas Berchtold.  I have been working in the software industry for over 20 years in various roles such as programmer, designer, architect or requirements engineer. Currently I am working as a software engineer/coach/architect in transformation projects with a focus on the definition and implementation of cloud native architectures as well as the enabling of teams on new methods and technologies.  While I still love to code, I am particularly passionate about the social aspects of software engineering.</description>
